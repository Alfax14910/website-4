      The complete platform for building an exchange
    body: |-
      RubyKube team forked the old abandoned open-source Peatio project
      and gave it a second birth. From monolith application we created
      an awesome stack of several key components that ensure more stability,
      scalability and security. Around Peatio, as wallet and order book
      management system, we have built KYC, Business Logic and other components,
      including Kite - installation & administration tool that reduces
      deployment from scratch to 1-1.5 hours. Plus we cover Back-End with
      beautiful and fully customizable Front-End using React.
